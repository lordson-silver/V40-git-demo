3. Open the integrated terminal

4. run `git clone _url_ `

5. The project should now be there

### Creating a branch

7. At this point, if you run `git branch` you will see the branches available: main; The \* shows which branch you are on. You should create your _working branch_ by running ` git branch _name-your-branch_`

8. If you run `git branch` you should now see your newly created branch listed, but if you notice, you are not on it yet, to go to your branch, run ` git checkout _your-branch-name_`

9. Run `git branch` again to ensure the \* is next to your branch

10. CODE ALL YOU WANT =)

### Pushing your branch to Github
