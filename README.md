### Cloning:

> To work on this project, click on the green button that reads code, and copy the http url

> If you already know how to use your terminal, feel free to do it. For those who don't:

1. Create a new folder on your computer

2. Open that folder on your IDE (VS Code, Atom, etc...)

3. Open the integrated terminal

4. run `git clone <url> `

5. run ` cd <project name>`

---

### Creating a branch

7. At this point, if you run `git branch` you will see the branches available: main; The \* shows which branch you are on. You should create your _working branch_ by running ` git branch <name-your-branch>`

8. If you run `git branch` you should now see your newly created branch listed, but if you notice, you are not on it yet, to go to your branch, run ` git checkout _your-branch-name_`

9. Run `git branch` again to ensure the \* is next to your branch

10. CODE ALL YOU WANT =)

---

### Commiting changes

11. When done coding, you must save your changes. It's good habit to first run `git status`

12. You now have a list of files and directories that changed compared to the last snapshot. They are not ready to be saved (commit) though, as shown by their status showing red

13. To add the to the staging area (place from where a commit can happen), run `git add <file-name>` Note: If you have many, you can add all at once by running `git add .`

14. Run `git status` again and now those files should be showing in green, which means they are READY to be commited.

15. To commit and finally save the changes, run `git commit -m "<what-did-you-change-between-double-quote>"`

16. You changes are now saved
